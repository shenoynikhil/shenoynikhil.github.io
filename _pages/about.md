# About Me
* I am a senior year undergraduate student in the [Biochemical Engineering Department](http://beb.iitd.ac.in) at [Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](http://www.iitd.ac.in). My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly deep unsupervised learning, as well as their applications in computational biology and generative modeling.
* I am currently pursuing a project with [Prof. Pratosh A P](https://sites.google.com/view/prathosh) at IIT Delhi, where I am working on improving latent representations of single cell RNA sequencing data using [variational inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.02082) and [GAN based](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/837302v1.full.pdf) approaches.
* I am looking for six month internship opportunites in the field of computer vision. I am also open to trying out quantitative researcher based roles.
