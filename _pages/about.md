# About Me
* I am an undergraduate student in the [Biochemical Engineering Department](http://beb.iitd.ac.in) at [Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](http://www.iitd.ac.in). My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly deep unsupervised learning, as well as their applications in computational biology and generative modeling.
* I am currently a Research Fellow at [The Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence](http://wadhwaniai.org/) working at the intersection of AI and social good.
