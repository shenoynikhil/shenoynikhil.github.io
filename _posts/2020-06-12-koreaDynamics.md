In 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-In met at the 38th Parallel, the line that divides the two countries. This was the 
first time since the Korean War (1950 - 1952) that a North Korean leader had entered the South Korean territory (pretty suprising, isn't it!). To understand why the 
equation between the two countries have been sour, we need to start from 1910.

Japanese Imperialism : 1910 - 1945
------
The Russo-Japanese war took place in 1904-1905 between the Russian Empire and the Empire of Japan, over Manchuria (North Eastern China) and the Korean Peninsula. Post Japanese victory in the war, Japan took control of the entire Korean peninsula when it was annexed in 1910. The Japanese continued to rule till 1945, during which it is understood that major efforts were made to obliterate the Korean culture. A cultural genocide as many Koreans say it, the Japanese destroyed historical texts, banned speaking Korean at educational institutions, forced worship at Japanese shrines and committed many other atrocities. The bureaucracy made it exclusive for people having Japanese names to get basic services like ration and mail delivery, so as to encourage Koreans to change their names. This resulted in at least 84% of Koreans changing their names. During World War II, around 700,000 Korean men were forced to work in Japanese colonies while women were used as sexual slaves in the military brothels. 

Division of Korea
------
After the nuclear bombing at Hiroshima-Nagasaki and the end of World War 2, the Japanese Empire retreated from the Korean peninsula resulting in a power vacuum. In 1945, the Soviets along with the United States, split the Peninsula into two halves without consulting the Korean populace. The northern half of the peninsula mostly consisted of labourers and peasants who preferred the communist ideologies of the Soviets whereas the southern half preferred US supported anti communist right wing ideologies. The middle class who did not agree with the communist policies of the Soviets escaped to the southern half of the peninsula.

The ultimate plan for the Soviets and the US was to let the Koreans decide their own future. In 1948, the UN mandated a sponsored vote for all the Koreans to decide the future of the peninsula. The north refused to take part, whereas the south followed through with the vote and formed a separate government led by the anti-communist Syngman Rhee. The Soviets installed a former communist leader Kim II Sung for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in the capital of Pyongyang. 

Korean War : 1950 - 1952
------
Both, Kim and Rhee wanted to unify Korea under their rule and made several attempts to do so. In 1950, North Korea launched an invasion with the help of the Soviet Leader Joseph Stalin which marked the beginning of the Korean War. The US had withdrawn most of its army but decided to get immediately involved in the war. The Security Council of the UN demanded the North Korean army to withdraw their army and return north of the border. When the North Koreans refused, the Security Council passed a second resolution asking all the member states to support the South Korean army. 
(**Fun Fact** : The Soviets could have vetoed this decision had they attended the meetings instead of boycotting them xD)

Almost 15 other countries including the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Canada, Turkey and Ethiopia fought with the South Korean army and the US Army in the Korean war. Although the intense parts of the war only lasted till the mid 1951, this was followed by truce talks and strategic attacks occasionally. Within a few months, both the sides decided to  divide the country along the battle line giving the South Korean's some extra territory than before the war. But the war did not end there due to a dispute over repatriation of Prisoners of War. The communists wanted the POWs to be sent home forcefully whereas the US wanted them to be able to choose. In 1953 following Stalin's death, the communists gave in. The fighting ended on 27 July 1953, when the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed. The agreement created the heavily fortified 2.5 mile wide Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to separate North and South Korea, and allowed the return of prisoners.

Post Korean War
------
Since the Armistice agreement, a peace treaty has **never** been signed between the two countries. Tensions remain high because of North Korea's nuclear weapons program. They have repeatedly declared the armistice as nullified and have resorted to border incursions and assasination attempts. North Korea also withdrew from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 2003 and have conducted six highly sophisticated nuclear tests since then. 

South Korea due to its strong ties with the west with an ongoing US army presence developed at a rapid rate and has become a fully democatric nation. Whereas North Korea remained to grow in isolation, particularly after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1990s, it is severely underdeveloped and is a massive police state with it's citizens under constant survelliance.
