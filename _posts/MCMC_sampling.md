## Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC)

MCMC Sampling is primarily used to sample from a complicated probability density function $p(x)$ or to approximate an expectation of a function $E[f(x)]$ where $x ~ p(x)$. To understand why this works well we need to understand some of the properties of a markov chain.
